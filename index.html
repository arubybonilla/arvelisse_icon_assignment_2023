<div><p>In 2021, 33.8 million people lived in food-insecure households.
Around 521,000 children lived in households in which one or more children experienced very low food security across the United States. Latinxs remain disproportionately impacted by food insecurity as food insecurity continues to unfairly impact racial and ethnic minorities. With COVID-19 restrictions easing throughout New York, many are still working towards a stable economic environment. Many variables in place are still impacting including a high price crisis that has sustained past the summer, and COVID-19’s impact on agriculture and production. Some of the causes of food insecurity include: poverty, unemployment, or low income, lack of affordable housing, chronic health conditions or lack of access to healthcare, systemic racism and racial discrimination.

<br>
While about one-third of native-born New York City households have inadequate income, 37% of naturalized citizens and 51% of non-citizens lack adequate income. Use of emergency food services increased among most New Yorkers during the pandemic and has for many a necessity, for example community fridges, SNAP, food banks and others. More than one in five SNAP participants are Latinxs. Latinxs also make up more than 40% of WIC participants across the country, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) latest annual report.
